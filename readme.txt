This plugin adds an GEORSS latitude/longitude based on the GPS info in the featured image when available.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an GEORSS latitude/longitude based on the GPS info in the featured image when available.
The GEO info is also stored in the database. This works together with my other GPS_MAP_widget plugin in that it uses the same metakey.
The image file is only read once.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget to a widgetarea. You can set the widget title, width and height in pixels, and the zoomlevel.
